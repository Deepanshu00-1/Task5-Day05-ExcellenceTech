# Testing Event Details & Registration Functionality

## Event Details Flow
Your application's event details functionality is already fully implemented in `src/pages/EventDetails.tsx`. When a user clicks on an event card, they are directed to this page which:

1. Fetches and displays event details
2. Shows registration progress
3. Displays event comments
4. Allows users to register for the event
5. Lets users favorite events and add comments

## How to Test the Flow

### 1. Create an Event (as an organizer)
1. Log in as test@organizer.com (which we've hardcoded as an organizer)
2. Go to the Events page and click "Create Event"
3. Fill in all required details and submit the form

### 2. View Event Details (as any user)
1. Log in as any user
2. Go to the Events page
3. Click "View Details" on any event card
4. You should see the complete event information including:
   - Name, description, category
   - Date and location
   - Registration status (spots filled)
   - Comments section

### 3. Register for an Event
1. While viewing an event, click the "Register Now" button
2. Fill in your name and email in the registration form
3. Click "Complete Registration"
4. The registration count should automatically update

### 4. Test Favorites
1. Click the heart icon on an event to favorite it
2. The heart should fill with color
3. Click again to unfavorite

### 5. Test Comments
1. Add a comment in the comment form
2. Click the send icon
3. Your comment should appear at the top of the comments list

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Event details not loading**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify that the event exists in your Supabase database
   - Ensure your Supabase client is properly configured

2. **Registration fails**:
   - Confirm user is logged in
   - Check registrations table in Supabase
   - Verify capacity hasn't been reached

3. **Comments not loading**:
   - Check profile table setup for user information
   - Ensure foreign key relationships are correctly set up
